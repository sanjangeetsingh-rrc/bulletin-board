# 📱 Bulletin Board

This is the mobile frontend for the Bulletin Board platform — an app designed to support group-based communication inspired by Harvard’s HIVE. It allows users to create, discover, and participate in discussion groups, with built-in support for role-based permissions and moderation.

This app interacts with the [Bulletin Board API](https://github.com/sanjangeetsingh-rrc/bulletin-board-api) and is built using **Jetpack Compose** for UI and **Kotlin** as the primary language.

> ⚠️ This app was built rapidly and may lack polish in areas like UI refinement, error handling, or accessibility. Contributions are encouraged.

## 💡 About the Idea

The idea came from trying to recreate the experience of structured, purpose-driven group chats — like bulletin boards — where membership and visibility could be controlled. Harvard's HIVE provided the initial spark, but this app builds on the concept by allowing customizable access controls, public visibility, and administrative tools.
